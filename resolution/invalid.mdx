Markets can be marked invalid if fair resolution isn't possible.

## Conditions

**Oracle Failure:**

- Insufficient data during TWAP window
- Oracle permanently down
- Data corrupted or clearly wrong

**Ambiguous Criteria:**

- Resolution terms unclear
- Interpretation disputed
- Multiple valid interpretations

**External Circumstances:**

- Event cancelled (e.g., game postponed indefinitely)
- Force majeure
- Unforeseen circumstances preventing resolution

## Settlement

All users receive full refunds:

YES holders → refund purchase price NO holders → refund purchase price

Fees → refunded

No one profits, no one loses. Market treated as if it never existed.

## Integrity Controls

Multisig can mark markets invalid if:

- Technical failure prevents fair resolution
- Resolution would be clearly unjust
- Community consensus that market should be voided

All invalid resolutions are logged and publicly visible.
