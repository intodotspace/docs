We imagine prediction markets as sources of calibrated signals that decision-makers use. Prediction markets will gather dispersed knowledge into honest forecasts useful for policy, corporate planning, and scientific inquiry. Woven into institutions, those signals will cut uncertainty, redirect effort toward what matters, and make truthful judgment valuable.

Open to anyone with curiosity or conviction - from careful analysts to those testing ideas with skin in the game - these markets will be both a tool for governance and a lively forum where beliefs are aired, challenged, and sharpened.
