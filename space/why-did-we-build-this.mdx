title: 'Why Did We Build This?'
---

We built this because we believe prediction markets can become a permissionless oracle of insight - a tool that helps societies, institutions, and individuals make decisions across an unlimited range of questions.

We believe the moment has arrived. The technology is trusted, the culture is attentive, and the need for clear signals is undeniable. Prediction markets are ready to live up to the role they were imagined for.

On top of the window of opportunity now open for prediction markets, we also see challenges that demand solutions. Most are already well recognized - by builders, analysts, and investors alike - and are waiting for decisive answers.

Problems with prediction markets:
- Low liquidity on events other than major US elections
    Difficult to bootstrap liquidity for less significant events
    Easy to manipulate bet odds by betting small amounts
    Lack of expert bets, since experts never even get to bet/vote for the outcome
- Unattractive returns
    - Low returns rates by default (bet goes from 0 or 1)
    - Long resolutions
- User experience  
     - Users get to bet on whatever the platform choses
     - User usually bet in a stablecoin chosen by the platform
     - User never get any fees from platform earnings
     - No retention mechanics (like daily tasks, steaks, etc heavily used in sports betting)
