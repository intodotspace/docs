## How It Works

![How To Pn](/images/how-to.png)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose a Market" titleSize="h3">
    Browse crypto, politics, sports, tech, economics, culture, and more. Pick [outcomes](/features/categories) you know better than the crowd does.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build Your Position" titleSize="h3">
    Buy YES or NO shares with [market orders](/guides/market-order) for instant fills, or set [limit orders](/guides/limit-order). Cash out anytime or hold until outcome [resolves](/concepts/resolution).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Multiply Your Returns" titleSize="h3">
    Multiply your exposure up to 10x with [leverage](/features/leverage). Small capital and big positions means outsized returns when you're right.
