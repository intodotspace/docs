title: 'How Prediction Markets Work'
---

Prediction markets let you bet on real-world outcomes. If you're right, you profit. If you're wrong, you lose. Markets aggregate these bets into probabilities that reflect collective belief about the future.

## The Basics

Every prediction market asks a yes-or-no question:
- "Will Bitcoin close above $150,000 in 2025?"
- "Will the Lakers win the championship?"
- "Will inflation drop below 2% this year?"

You buy shares in YES or NO. Each share pays $1 if you're correct, $0 if you're wrong.

## How Prices Work

Share prices represent probability:
- YES shares at $0.35 = 35% chance the outcome happens
- NO shares at $0.65 = 65% chance it doesn't

Prices always sum to $1 because one outcome must occur.

## Why This Matters

When thousands of people bet real money, prices reveal what informed participants actually believeâ€”not what they say in polls or tweets. Money on the line creates accuracy.

**Example:**

You think Bitcoin will hit $150K. YES shares trade at $0.35. You buy 1,000 shares for $350.

**If you're right:** Each share pays $1. You receive $1,000. Net profit: $650.

**If you're wrong:** Shares are worthless. You lose $350.

**If you exit early:** Prices update as news breaks. If YES rises to $0.60, you can sell for $600 (profit: $250) without waiting for resolution.

That's prediction markets. Space makes them faster, deeper, and more capital-efficient.
