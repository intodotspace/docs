title: "Market Resolution"
---

Market resolution methods depend on the market itself. Some markets such as crypto price outcomes are resolved using on-chain data at the expiration date. This is referred to as a deterministic resolution.

Others must be determined manually by the team within 24h of market expiry, like other major prediction platforms, to prevent manipulation and bad actors. This is referred to as a subjective resolution.

And later versions of Space will explore advanced techniques to implement market resolution algorithms, such as zkML and zkTLS, of which we will be the first to utilize.

## Rules and Logic

Each market has its own resolution rules and logic which will be stated in the description of the market beneath the chart. This is what dictates outcome resolution.
