## The Future We're Building

In five years, prediction markets won't be niche tools for traders - they'll be infrastructure that institutions, governments, and individuals rely on to make better decisions.

## Policy & Governance

City councils check prediction markets before infrastructure votes. Federal agencies use aggregated forecasts to allocate disaster relief funds. International bodies monitor markets tracking diplomatic tensions, giving early warning signals that prevent escalation.

Instead of relying solely on expert committees and polling data, decision-makers have access to real-time probability estimates backed by capital - signals that update instantly as new information emerges.

## Corporate Planning

Companies use prediction markets internally and externally. Will this product launch succeed? Should we expand to this market? Which candidate should we hire? Employees bet with real stakes, aggregating dispersed knowledge that no single executive could gather. The result: fewer catastrophic mistakes, faster pivots, better capital allocation.

## Scientific Research

Researchers bet on replication outcomes before studies are published. Funding committees check market odds on project success before allocating grants. Markets identify promising research directions early, redirecting resources toward breakthroughs that matter.

## Individual Decision-Making

Before buying a house, you check markets on local property values. Before choosing a career path, you see what industries show strong growth signals. Before major life decisions, you access aggregated wisdom from thousands of informed participants.

## Space is building that infrastructure.

Not for one election or one asset class, but for every question where dispersed knowledge needs coordination. Not as entertainment, but as tools that make truthful judgment valuable and useful.

## The endpoint

A world where prediction markets are as fundamental to decision-making as search engines are to information discovery - invisible infrastructure that everyone relies on without thinking about it.
