<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose a Market" titleSize="h3">
    Browse crypto, politics, sports, tech, economics, culture, and more. Pick outcomes you know better than the crowd does.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build Your Position" titleSize="h3">
    Buy YES or NO shares with market orders for instant fills, or set limit orders. Cash out anytime or hold until outcome resolves.
  </Step>
