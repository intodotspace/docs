Space distributes $SPACE to users through seasonal airdrops. Your share is determined by the points you've earned - the more points, the larger your airdrop. Top performers also receive invitations to exclusive events.

Point calculation details and eligibility requirements are announced before each season begins. Points reset at the start of each new season.
