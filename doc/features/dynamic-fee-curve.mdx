title: "Dynamic Fee Curve"
---

Our dynamic fee curve is designed as an incentive alignment mechanism for [Makers & Takers](doc/core-concepts/makers-and-takers) which uses fee asymmetry in order to achieve the following:

- Reward early participation, conviction and risk taking
- Maintain orderly books
- Reward makers for providing deeper liquidity (see: [rewards](/doc/features/rewards/liquidity-rewards))
- Incentivize consistent, long term participation
- Punish market manipulation

<DynamicFeeCurve />

Traders adding liquidity to the order book via limit orders (makers) pay 0 fees. The below fees only apply to market orders that get filled instantly (takers).

There are two types of taker fees which are created to keep the orderbook and risk/reward balanced:

1. **Buy Fee**: when a market order position is opened, fees start higher during uncertain phases of the market where your odds are highest and gradually decrease as the market gains more certainty

$$
F_{\text{buy}} (p) = F_{\text{min}} + (F_{\text{max}} - F_{\text{min}}) \times (1-(p/100)^{\alpha})
$$

where

- $F_{\text{buy}} (p)$: Buy-side fee at probability $p \%$
- $F_{\text{max}} = 2.00\%$: Maximum fee at $0\%$ probability (highest uncertainty)
- $F_{\text{min}} = 0.02\%$: Minimum fee at $100\%$ probability (certainty)
- $\alpha = 1.3$: Curve-shape coefficient (controls smoothness of decline)\
\
    **Example:** \
    At $p = 20\%$, $F_{\text{buy}}(20) \approx 1.76\%$ but you're buying contracts that could pay out \$1 (400% ROI) so your odds are better \
    At $p = 80\%$, $F_{\text{buy}}(80) \approx 0.10\%$ you'll pay a 0.05% buy fee but your upside is smaller at \$0.25 (25% ROI) as your odds are worse

2. **Sell Fee:** if you wait until the market is resolved or you place a limit order to exit that doesn't get triggered immediately you are a maker and therefore do not pay any fee. However, if you want to close your position early via a market order, you need to understand that fees peak near the midpoint (at 50% probably or \$0.50) where uncertainty and volatility are highest; neither YES or NO sides have a clear informational advantage. This is the point where price manipulation and short-term flipping are most likely to occur therefore in order to protect market integrity and stabilize pricing, fees are highest (1%) and taper off towards either side as outcomes become more certain (0.02%).

    $$
    F_{\text{sell}} (p) = F_{\text{min}} + (F_{\text{peak}} - F_{\text{min}}) \times e^{-0.5 (\frac{p-50}{\sigma})^2}
    $$

    where

    - $F_{\text{sell}} (p)$: Sell-side fee at probability $p \%$
    - $F_{\text{peak}} = 1.00\%$: Maximum fee at $50\%$ probability (maximum uncertainty)
    - $F_{\text{min}} = 0.02\%$: Minimum fee at $100\%$ probability (certainty)
    - $\alpha = 1.3$: Curve-shape coefficient (controls smoothness of decline)

    At \$0.50 (50% probability) your sell fee is 1%

    At \$0.20 (20% probability) your sell fee is approximately 0.12%\
    \
    **Example:**\
    You wish to enter the trade below via a market order (if you entered via limit order you wouldn't pay any fee).

|                    | **Value**                                       |
|------------------------------:|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Market Order Type**         | Market (fee applies; limit orders have no fee)  |
| **Market**                    | "Will BTC close above \$150,000 this year?"     |
| **Current BTC Price**         | \$125,000                                       |
| **Current Market Probability**| 30%                                             |
| **Shares to Buy**             | 1,000 YES shares at \$0.30                      |

<Steps>
  <Step title="Opening your position" titleSize="h3">
    - Position size: 1,000 x \$0.30 = \$300
    - Buy fee  ≈ 1.6% (\$4.80)
    - **Total cost:** \$304.80
  </Step>
  <Step title="If you wish to close your position, before market resolution" titleSize="h3">
    - BTC rallies to \$145 and market probability rises to 80%
    - Sell price: \$0.80 x 1,000 = \$800
    - Sell fee  ≈ 0.04% (\$0.32)
    - Net proceeds: \$799.68
    - **Net profit:** \$800 - \$0.32 - \$304.80 = \$494.88 (162% ROI)
