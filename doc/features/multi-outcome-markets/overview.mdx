Multi-Outcome Markets allow you to trade on events with multiple results where only one can be true. Instead of creating separate binary (YES/NO) markets for each possibility, Space consolidates all related outcomes into a single unified market with shared liquidity. This architecture improves capital efficiency and provides deeper liquidity by linking all outcomes together through a share conversion mechanism.

## How It Works

Each outcome has its own YES and NO orderbook, but all outcomes are interconnected through a shared liquidity system and only one outcome can win like a multiple-choice question.

**Example Market:** _"Which world leader will make a state visit to the White House first in 2026?"_

| **#** | **Leader**          | **Country** | **Options** |
|------:|---------------------|-------------|--------------|
| 1     | Emmanuel Macron     | France      | YES / NO     |
| 2     | Keir Starmer        | UK          | YES / NO     |
| 3     | Narendra Modi       | India       | YES / NO     |
| 4     | Fumio Kishida       | Japan       | YES / NO     |
| 5     | Other               | —           | YES / NO     |

Each outcome works like a normal binary market, but with one critical advantage; NO shares can be converted between outcomes.
