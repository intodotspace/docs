title: "Share Conversion Mechanism"
---
If you hold NO shares for outcome 1 (Emmanuel Macron - France) you are essentially saying that one of the other leaders will visit first. This means your NO shares can be converted into YES shares for any other outcome in that market.

**Example:**
- You hold 1,000 NO shares for outcome 1 Emmanuel Macron.
- You change your mind and think outcome 2, Keir Starmer, is more likely.
- You can convert your 1,000 NO shares from outcome 1 for 1,000 YES shares of outcome 2 without having to add any additional capital.
