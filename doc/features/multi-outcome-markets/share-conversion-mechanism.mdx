### Share Conversion Mechanism

If you hold NO shares for outcome 1 (Emmanuel Macron - France) you are essentially saying that one of the other leaders will visit first. This means your NO shares can be converted into YES shares for any other outcome in that market.

**Example:**

- You hold 1,000 NO shares for outcome 1 Emmanuel Macron.
- You change your mind and think outcome 2, Keir Starmer, is more likely.
- You can convert your 1,000 NO shares from outcome 1 for 1,000 YES shares of outcome 2 without having to add any additional capital.

### Hedging Across Multiple Outcomes

Another added benefit of Space's Multi-Outcome Markets is that it gives you the flexibility to spread your risk.

**Example:**\
You can convert your 1,000 NO shares from Macron into 500 YES shares of Starmer and an additional 500 YES shares of Modi covering both bases and spreading your risk.
