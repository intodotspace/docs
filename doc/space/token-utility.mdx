title: "Token Utility"
---

\$SPACE token utility is designed to enhance the efficiency and usability of prediction markets without restricting demand from the user base. Requiring users to buy, hold or stake tokens in order to use a product gates access to it; Space enables everyone to use the platform without forcing them to interact with the token as this would limit demand and user base.

Token utility ties value to the platform performance, not just speculation via our [flywheel mechanism](./flywheel-mechanism/overview); direct exposure to platform success through revenue sharing played a major part in the success of Raydium & Aerodrome ([CFA Institute, 2025](https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2025/01/24/beyond-speculation-the-rise-of-revenue-sharing-tokens/)).

1. **Exclusive Market Access:** Specialised markets will be accessible exclusively using \$SPACE as the trading currency. This creates unique opportunities for token holders while maintaining broad market access in USDC for the general user base.
2. **Rewards and Incentives:** Airdrops: accumulate points through your activity on Space to qualify for airdrops Referral Rewards: earn rewards by referring new users to Space that deposit USDC and trade Trading Competitions: participate in trading competitions with \$SPACE prize pools
3. **Market Protection Mechanism:** To protect market integrity on high-volume trades, users placing bids significantly larger than existing market volume must burn \$SPACE tokens. This mechanism prevents market manipulation by making disproportionately large positions more costly. (e.g. volume = \$10M, user wants to bid \$5M more).

   This helps with protecting markets from manipulation for example when Kamala Harris turned the odds on Polymarket in her favour with a \$20M bet.
