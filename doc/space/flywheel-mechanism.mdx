title: "Flywheel Mechanism"
---

## Overview

Space's Flywheel Mechanism creates a self-sustaining cycle that aligns platform growth with token value through an automated fee-to-value system. By channeling trading activity directly into \$SPACE buybacks and burns, deflationary pressure is created which benefits all ecosystem participants.

## Fee Distribution

All platform fees generated from trading activity are automatically split:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Buyback & Burn $SPACE" icon="fire" iconType="solid" color="#00FF00">
    50% of revenue
  </Card>
  <Card title="Protocol Treasury" icon="building-columns" iconType="solid" color="#00FF00">
    50% of revenue
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

This allocation is fixed in the smart contract and provides:

- **Immediate value return** to token holders through supply reduction
- **Sustainable funding** for platform operations, development and security
- **Transparent allocation** with all transactions visible on-chain

## The Flywheel Effect

The mechanism creates a self-sustaining growth cycle:

    A["More Trading<br/>Volume"] --> B["More Fees<br/>Generated"]
    B --> C["More $SPACE<br/>Bought Back"]
    C --> D["More $SPACE<br/>Burned"]
    D --> E["Increased Scarcity<br/>& Token Value"]
    E --> F["Higher<br/>Rewards"]
    F --> G["More Attractive<br/>Economics"]
    G --> H["More Users<br/>Join"]
    H --> A["More Trading Volume"]
```

</div>

Each component reinforces the others, creating compounding growth as the platform scales. The Flywheel Mechanism creates a virtuous cycle where platform success directly benefits token holders through:

- **Automated buybacks** using TWAP for optimal execution
- **Permanent burns** reducing supply continuously
- **Treasury funding** ensuring platform growth
- **Transparent operations** with public dashboard
- **Sustainable economics** balancing value return and development

As Space grows, the flywheel spins faster - more users generate more fees, driving larger burns, increasing scarcity, attracting more users, and perpetuating the cycle. This alignment of incentives between users, traders, liquidity providers, and token holders creates a foundation for Spaceâ€™s long-term success.
