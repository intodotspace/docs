title: "Fee Distribution"
---

All platform fees generated from trading activity are automatically split:
- **50%** → Buyback & Burn $SPACE
- **50%** → Protocol Treasury

This allocation is fixed in the smart contract and provides:
- **Immediate value return** to token holders through supply reduction
- **Sustainable funding** for platform operations, development and security
- **Transparent allocation** with all transactions visible on-chain
