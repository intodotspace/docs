title: "The Flywheel Effect"

The mechanism creates a self-sustaining growth cycle:

<div align="center">
```mermaid
graph TD
    A["More Trading Volume"] --> B["More Fees Generated"]
    B --> C["More $SPACE Bought Back (Increasing Price)"]
    C --> D["More $SPACE Burned (Reducing Supply)"]
    D --> E["Increased Scarcity & Token Value"]
    E --> F["Higher Rewards"]
    F --> G["More Attractive Platform Economics"]
    G --> H["More Users & Traders Join"]
    H --> A["More Trading Volume"]
```
</div>

Each component reinforces the others, creating compounding growth as the platform scales. The Flywheel Mechanism creates a virtuous cycle where platform success directly benefits token holders through:
- **Automated buybacks** using TWAP for optimal execution
- **Permanent burns** reducing supply continuously
- **Treasury funding** ensuring platform growth
- **Transparent operations** with public dashboard
- **Sustainable economics** balancing value return and development

As Space grows, the flywheel spins faster - more users generate more fees, driving larger burns, increasing scarcity, attracting more users, and perpetuating the cycle. This alignment of incentives between users, traders, liquidity providers, and token holders creates a foundation for Spaceâ€™s long-term success.
