description: "What our token does"

\$SPACE token utility is designed to enhance the efficiency and usability of prediction markets without restricting demand from the user base. Requiring users to buy, hold or stake tokens in order to use a product gates access to it; Space enables everyone to use the platform without forcing them to interact with the token as this would limit demand and user base.

Token utility ties value to the platform performance, not just speculation via our [flywheel mechanism](/token/flywheel); direct exposure to platform success through revenue sharing played a major part in the success of Raydium & Aerodrome ([CFA Institute, 2025](https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2025/01/24/beyond-speculation-the-rise-of-revenue-sharing-tokens/)).
