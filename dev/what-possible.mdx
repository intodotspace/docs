Space provides the infrastructure for prediction markets. Here are some examples of what developers will be able to build on top.

## Trading Tools

**Automated Bots**\
Monitor probability movements and execute strategies. Buy when the market underprices an outcome, sell when it corrects. Space's 0% maker fees and transparent order book make algorithmic trading viable.

_Example strategy:_ Mean reversion bot that buys YES shares when probability drops below historical average and sells when it rises above threshold.

**Arbitrage Scanners**\
Compare Space prices to Polymarket, Kalshi, or traditional betting markets. Execute when spreads exceed transaction fees.\
Multi-outcome markets create additional arbitrage opportunities - if NO shares for one outcome are mispriced relative to YES shares for another, convert and capture the spread.

**Portfolio Managers**\
Track positions across multiple markets, calculate total PnL, manage risk exposure. With leverage available, capital efficiency matters. Portfolio tools help users optimize allocation and monitor liquidation risk.

**Alert Systems**\
Notify users when:

- Probability hits specific threshold
- Large trades execute (whale watching)
- Market approaching resolution
- Liquidation risk increases

Real-time WebSocket feeds make this straightforward. Push notifications via email, SMS, Discord, or Telegram.

## Analytics Platforms

**Market Dashboards**\
Visualize trends, volume, and liquidity across markets. Answer questions like:

- Which outcomes are moving?
- Where is capital flowing?
- What do traders believe?
- How has sentiment changed over time?

Build charts showing probability evolution, volume heatmaps, and trader activity patterns.

**Trader Leaderboards**\
Track top performers across markets. Show:

- Total ROI over time periods
- Win rate on resolved markets
- Average position size
- Risk-adjusted returns

Prediction markets reward accuracy. Make reputation visible and trackable.

**Historical Analysis**\
Backtest trading strategies against historical market data. Study:

- Market behavior at different time horizons
- When probabilities stabilize before resolution
- Correlation between market movements and news events
- Accuracy of prediction markets vs. other forecasting methods

**Whale Watching**\
Monitor large trades that significantly move markets. Alert when conviction bets happen. In thin markets, size matters - track who’s making bold predictions and how often they’re right.

## Data Services

**Price Feeds**\
Aggregate Space probabilities for external use. Potential applications:

- DeFi protocols using prediction market odds as oracle inputs
- Research firms studying market sentiment
- News organizations tracking real-time sentiment on events
- Traditional finance firms incorporating prediction data

**News Integration**\
Correlate market movements with breaking news:

- When did the market react to an announcement?
- How fast did probabilities update after news broke?
- What information moved the odds the most?
- Which news sources have the strongest impact?

Build tools that overlay news timelines on price charts, identify market-moving events, and track information propagation speed.

**Sentiment Analysis**\
Compare prediction market probabilities to:

- Social media sentiment (Twitter, Reddit)
- Traditional polling data
- Expert forecasts
- Betting market odds

Identify where the market disagrees with conventional wisdom. These divergences often signal valuable information or mispricing.

## DeFi Integrations

**Collateral Protocols**\
Use shares as collateral for loans. YES shares trading at \$0.80 have predictable value - lend against them. Create lending pools where users can borrow USDC against their prediction market positions.

**Yield Strategies**\
Automated liquidity provision:

- Place limit orders on both sides of order book
- Capture bid-ask spread as profit
- Rebalance as market moves
- Optimize for markets with highest volume/spread ratio

Earn yield by providing depth to markets while maintaining market-neutral exposure.

**Derivatives**\
Build options or structured products on prediction markets:

- Call/put options on market probabilities
- Range-bound products (profit if probability stays within range)
- Volatility products (profit from probability swings)

Space provides the base layer. Derivatives add leverage and new risk/reward profiles.

## Example: Trading Bot Flow

A bot monitoring BTC price markets:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Monitor Market">
    Fetch current probability via REST API.\
    Subscribe to trades via WebSocket for real-time updates.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Evaluate Opportunity">
    Compare current probability to historical average.\
    Check if below entry threshold (e.g., 30%).\
    Calculate position size based on conviction and risk limits.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute Trade">
    Place limit order slightly below current price.\
    Pay 0% fee as maker.\
    Monitor for fill via WebSocket.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manage Position">
    Track unrealized PnL as probability changes.\
    Set exit target (e.g., sell when probability reaches 50%).\
    Implement stop-loss if needed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Exit">
    Place limit sell order when target hit.\
    Or use market order for immediate exit (pays dynamic fee).\
    Calculate realized PnL.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Repeat">
    Track performance across trades.\
    Adjust strategy based on results.
  </Step>
</Steps>

All of this is possible with Space's transparent order book, real-time data feeds, and 0% maker fees.
