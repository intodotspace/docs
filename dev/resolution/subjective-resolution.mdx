title: "Subjective Resolution"
---
Politics, sports, and culture markets require human judgment. Space uses a combination of operator multisig and AI validation.

## Resolution Process
<div align="center">
```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Market Expires"] --> B["Multisig Submits Outcome"]
```
</div>
<Steps>
  <Step title="Operator Multisig" titleSize="h3">
    2-of-3 operator multisig submits resolution including:
    - Market ID
    - Outcome (YES/NO or specific outcome)
    - Evidence URL
    - Content hash
    - Timestamp
    - 2 of 3 signatures
  </Step>
  <Step title="AI Validation" titleSize="h3">
    AI validates outcome against evidence before on-chain submission:
    - Parse evidence source
    - Compare to market resolution criteria
    - Flag if mismatch

    If AI disagrees, transaction is blocked and admins alerted.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Post-Submission Check" titleSize="h3">
    After on-chain submission, AI validates again:
    - Confirm submitted outcome matches evidence
    - Alert admins if discrepancy detected
    - Enable challenge period
  </Step>
  <Step title="Challenge Period" titleSize="h3">
    24-48 hours (configurable per market) for community review:
    - Users can flag incorrect resolutions
    - Flagged markets go to admin review
    - Override possible if clearly wrong
  </Step>
</Steps>
