## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Explore the API" titleSize="h3">
    No authentication required for public market data. Start experimenting:

    - `GET /markets` - See available markets
    - `GET /markets/{id}` - Get detailed market info
    - `GET /markets/{id}/orderbook` - View current liquidity
    - Test **WebSocket** connections for real-time feeds
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build Locally" titleSize="h3">
    While the platform is in development:

    - Mock market data for testing
    - Design your integration architecture
    - Plan data flows and error handling
    - Prepare for API launch
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go Live" titleSize="h3">
    When the production API launches:

    - Connect to live endpoints
    - Monitor **rate limits** in response headers
    - Implement proper error handling
    - Deploy your integration
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

**Caching**

Cache data that doesn’t change frequently:

- Market metadata (question, expiry, category)
- Historical trade data

**Refresh regularly:**

- Current prices - every **5–10 seconds**
- Order book depth - **real-time via WebSocket**
- Volume statistics - **every minute**

**WebSocket Reconnection** Networks fail. Your integration should handle it:

- Implement **automatic reconnection**
- Use **exponential backoff** (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s…)
- **Resubscribe** to channels after reconnection
- Consider **max retry attempts** before alerting

## Error Handling

Smart retry logic:

- **5xx errors** - Retry with backoff (server issue, likely temporary)
- **4xx errors** - Don’t retry (client error, fix your request)
- **429 (Rate Limit)** - Respect `Retry-After` header, then retry
- **Network errors** - Retry with backoff

## Rate Limit Management

Stay under limits:

- Track requests per minute locally
- Check `X-RateLimit-Remaining` header
- Back off before hitting the limit
- Use **WebSocket** for real-time data instead of polling
