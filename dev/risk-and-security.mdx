title: "Risk & Security"
---

Space implements multiple layers of risk controls to protect users and maintain market integrity.

## Oracle Security

**Multi-Source Validation:**

- Median of Pyth + Switchboard prices
- Reject if oracles disagree by \>2%
- 15-minute TWAP averages out manipulation

**Liveness Checks:**

- Require minimum updates in TWAP window
- Extend window if oracle temporarily down
- Mark invalid if insufficient data

**Price Clamping:**

- Maximum 1% price movement per minute
- Outlier detection: reject prices \>3 standard deviations
- Multi-feed median prevents single-source manipulation

## Circuit Breakers

Markets automatically pause if price moves:

- 10% in \<60 seconds
- 25% in \<5 minutes

**On Trigger:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Trading paused immediately" titleSize="h3">
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Switch to call auction mode" titleSize="h3">
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Admins alerted" titleSize="h3">
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic resume after cooldown or manual approval" titleSize="h3">
    
  </Step>
</Steps>

Prevents flash crashes and manipulation attempts.

## Liquidation Controls

Position Value \< Maintenance Margin → Liquidation

**Liquidation Process:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Liquidate 25% of position" titleSize="h3">
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply 10% penalty to insurance fund" titleSize="h3">
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check if still underwater" titleSize="h3">
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="If yes: liquidate another 25%" titleSize="h3">
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Repeat until position safe or fully liquidated" titleSize="h3">
    
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Insurance Fund:**

- Funded by liquidation penalties (10% of liquidated value)
- Plus 5% of all platform fees
- Covers negative balances from latency/congestion
- Balance publicly visible on-chain
- Target reserve: 2% of platform TVL The insurance fund protects the platform from user accounts going negative due to rapid price movements or network congestion preventing timely liquidation.

## Pre-Event Freeze

Markets can implement freeze mechanisms before resolution:

**Option 1: Fee Escalation**

Time to resolution \< 10 minutes: $\text{Taker Fee} \times 3$

Time to resolution \< 5 minutes: $\text{Taker Fee} \times 5$

**Option 2: Position Freeze**

Time to resolution \< 5 minutes:

- New positions: DISABLED
- Exit positions: ENABLED

Prevents last-second manipulation with insider information or unfair advantage from faster information access.

## Slippage Protection

Users set maximum acceptable slippage on market orders (default 5%).

If $\frac{|\text{Actual Fill Price} - \text{Expected Price}|}{ \text{Expected Price}} > \text{Max Slippage}$: → Revert transaction → No trade executed → No fees charged

Protects users from unexpected execution prices in volatile or thin markets.

## Platform Upgrades

**Timelock Requirements:**

- Parameter changes: 48-hour timelock
- Critical code changes: 72-hour timelock

**Multisig Control:**

- 3-of-5 multisig for admin functions
- 2-of-3 multisig for resolution submissions
- 2-of-5 multisig for emergency pause (faster response)

All governance actions are transparent and logged on-chain.

## Future: zkML & zkTLS Research

Space is researching zero-knowledge proofs for an even more cutting-edge, trustless subjective resolution yet to be utilized within prediction markets:

**zkML (Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning):**

- Prove AI model output without revealing model weights
- On-chain verification of resolution logic
- No trust required in resolution operators

**zkTLS (Zero-Knowledge Transport Layer Security):**

- Prove data was fetched from specific URL
- Cryptographic proof of source authenticity
- Combine with zkML for fully automated resolution

**Combined Architecture:** Fetch news article via zkTLS → Process with zkML → Submit proof on-chain → Automatic resolution with cryptographic guarantees.
