## Thread Frameworks

### Framework 1: "Polymarket × Hyperliquid"

1. Polymarket proved \$20B+ demand. Hyperliquid proved retention works. @intodotspace = both
2. First leveraged prediction market on Solana
3. 10x leverage, 100x+ gains on real-world outcomes
4. CLOB with 0% maker fees = deep liquidity
5. 50% revenue → buyback & burn = deflationary flywheel
6. Gamified points, seasonal airdrops, referral rewards
7. Built by \$1.5B UFO team. 4 years proven execution

### Framework 2: "Why Space Dominates"

1. Prediction markets had 3 fatal flaws: low returns, thin liquidity, zero retention
2. @intodotspace kills all three
3. **Returns**: 10x leverage breaks the 0-1 cap. 100x+ gains possible
4. **Liquidity**: CLOB with 0% maker fees + multi-outcome markets
5. **Retention**: Hyperliquid playbook—ranks, airdrops, rewards, battles
6. **Tokenomics**: 50% fee burn = constant deflationary pressure
