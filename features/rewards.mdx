**Space Liquidity Rewards**

Space rewards makers for providing liquidity (see more: [Makers & Takers](./clob/makers-and-takers)) through placing limit orders and keeping the markets balanced by distributing **$SPACE** tokens based on their contribution. 

Markets are only as good as the capital that holds them open. To keep prices honest across horizons and topics, we will pay liquidity rewards - simple, predictable incentives that nudge capital where it is most useful.

Putting liquidity into a market will be as easy as placing a limit order. No special contracts, no hidden mechanics: commit an order, earn a share of rewards when it helps price discovery.

Reward size will be rule-driven and aligned with Space’s public aims:
- **Time for resolution.** Longer-dated markets receive higher rewards. If a market settles months or years from now, it must overcome the natural reluctance to lock funds. Higher rewards correct that bias.

- **Quality of the commitment.** Orders closest to the centre (50¢ on binary markets) and of meaningful size earn more. This rewards true liquidity, not token gestures. A minimum order size will apply to prevent gaming of the system.

Fees that fund rewards will also feed insurance and platform longevity, so rewarding liquidity simultaneously builds resilience. The aim is simple: make it cheap and worthwhile to supply real depth where the public needs reliable signals most.
