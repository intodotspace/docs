description: "Real-time trading without waiting for expiry"

Space will operate continuous trading markets rather than simple binary settle-at-expiry events. Users will be able to enter or exit positions at any time before [resolution](/concepts/resolution), enabling them to:

- Manage risk
- Lock in profits
- Cut losses
- Exit positions early

Users can close their positions prior to resolution using the [market order](/guides/market-order) or [limit order](/guides/limit-order) options.

This continuous liquidity mechanism gives more control to the user while enhancing price discovery; as new information arrives, the market price will adjust dynamically to reflect evolving probabilities.

<Note>
  Positions can get partially filled if buyers match only a part of the sell order
