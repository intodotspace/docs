\$SPACE is distributed to users through seasonal airdrops. Your share is determined by the points you've earned - the more points, the larger your airdrop. Top performers also receive invitations to exclusive events.

## What Are Points

Points measure meaningful participation on Space: trading, providing [limit-order liquidity](/features/rewards), referrals, and ongoing engagement. They are an auditable record Space uses when distributing airdrops. Points are a participation metric, not a token or guarantee of future rewards.

Point calculation details and eligibility requirements are announced before each season begins, and points reset at the start of each new season.

- Community participation
- Engagement on social platforms

## Airdrops

Airdrops on Space are a distribution tool, not a giveaway. They align ownership with the people who actually use the product - traders, liquidity providers, affiliates. Distributing tokens to real participants strengthens decentralization and rewards behavior that make markets liquid and reliable.

## Seasons

Space distributes ownership through Seasons: time-bounded reward periods that align token distribution with genuine platform usage. Each Season measures contribution and broadens community ownership.

**How It Works:**

1. **Announcement:** Space publishes duration, reward weightings, and eligibility criteria before each Season.
2. **Earn Points:** Trade, engage, bring users via referrals, maintain streaks, or provide liquidity.
3. **Snapshot:** Space records participation data when the Season ends.
4. **Distribution:** Ecosystem rewards are distributed to eligible wallets, proportional to verified Points.
5. **Reset:** Points reset and a new Season begins with updated weights and features.

## Why Seasons Matter

Long-term value is created when ownership aligns with ecosystem participation. Giving broad ownership to real users creates stronger network effects, deeper liquidity, and higher platform trust - and ends up rallying the token rather than causing a dump ([Hyperliquid, 2025](https://nodescience.medium.com/ultimate-guide-on-hyperliquid-season-2-07-19-updated-bb16870f4d98)). Space turns users into stakeholders, and engagement into equity.
