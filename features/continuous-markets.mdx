title: "Continuous Markets"
---

Space will operate continuous trading markets rather than simple binary settle-at-expiry events. Users will be able to enter or exit positions at any time before resolution, enabling them to:
- Manage risk
- Lock in profits
- Cut losses
- Exit positions early

Users can close their positions prior to resolution using the market order or limit order options.

This continuous liquidity mechanism gives more control to the user while enhancing price discovery; as new information arrives, the market price will adjust dynamically to reflect evolving probabilities.

<Note>Positions can get partially filled if buyers match only a part of the sell order</Note>
