Funding rates keep leveraged markets stable - when the price deviates too far from fair value, small hourly payments are exchanged between long and short traders. If your collateral falls below the maintenance threshold, part or all of your position is closed automatically to protect system stability.

\text{Position Size} = \text{Margin} \times \text{Leverage}

and
$$
\text{PnL} = (\text{Exit Price} \ - \ \text{Entry Price}) \times \text{Shares})
