Multi-Outcome Markets allow you to trade on events with multiple results where only one can be true. Instead of creating separate binary (YES/NO) markets for each possibility, Space consolidates all related outcomes into a single unified market with shared liquidity. This architecture improves capital efficiency and provides deeper liquidity by linking all outcomes together through a share conversion mechanism.

## How It Works

Each outcome has its own YES and NO orderbook, but all outcomes are interconnected through a shared liquidity system and only one outcome can win like a multiple-choice question.

**Example Market:** _"Which world leader will make a state visit to the White House first in 2026?"_

1. Emmanuel Macron - France [YES / NO]
2. Keir Starmer - UK [YES / NO]
3. Narendra Modi - India [YES / NO]
4. Fumio Kishida - Japan [YES / NO]
5. Other [YES / NO]

Each outcome works like a normal binary market, but with one critical advantage; NO shares can be converted between outcomes.
