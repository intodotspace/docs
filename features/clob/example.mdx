**FIX CLOB INTRO**

**LATEX NEEDED?**

Market: ‘Will BTC close above \$150,000 in 2025?’
- The YES price is $0.25 which means the market thinks there is a 25% chance this will happen
- You decide to buy 1,000 YES shares at $0.25
- If BTC closes above \$150,000, your YES shares are now worth \$1 each - you will receive \$1,000, making you \$750 net profit. 
- If BTC closes above \$150,000, your YES shares are worth \$0 and you lose your \$250 bet
- If you wish to exit your trade before the end of the expiry date, you’ll be able to see the current price/probability of the outcome, let’s say the market is sitting at \$0.50 (50% probability), your shares are now worth 2x more so you can simply sell your 1,000 shares you bought at \$0.25 for \$0.50 each, taking out \$500, making you \$250 net profit.
