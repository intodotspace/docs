Multi-Outcome Markets allow you to trade on events with multiple results where only one can be true. Instead of creating separate binary (YES/NO) markets for each possibility, Space consolidates all related outcomes into a single unified market with shared liquidity. This architecture improves capital efficiency and provides deeper liquidity by linking all outcomes together through a share conversion mechanism.

## How It Works

Each outcome has its own YES and NO orderbook, but all outcomes are interconnected through a shared liquidity system and only one outcome can win like a multiple-choice question.

**Example Market:** _"Which world leader will make a state visit to the White House first in 2026?"_

| **#** | **Leader**      | **Country** | **Options** |
| ----: | --------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1     | Emmanuel Macron | France      | YES/NO      |
| 2     | Keir Starmer    | UK          | YES/NO      |
| 3     | Narendra Modi   | India       | YES/NO      |
| 4     | Fumio Kishida   | Japan       | YES/NO      |
| 5     | Other           | â€”           | YES/NO      |

Each outcome works like a normal binary market, but with one critical advantage; NO shares can be converted between outcomes.

If you hold NO shares for outcome 1 (Emmanuel Macron - France) you are essentially saying that one of the other leaders will visit first. This means your NO shares can be converted into YES shares for any other outcome in that market.

**Example:**

- You hold 1,000 NO shares for outcome 1 Emmanuel Macron.
- You change your mind and think outcome 2, Keir Starmer, is more likely.
- You can convert your 1,000 NO shares from outcome 1 for 1,000 YES shares of outcome 2 without having to add any additional capital.

## Share Conversion Mechanism

If you hold NO shares for outcome 1 (Emmanuel Macron - France) you are essentially saying that one of the other leaders will visit first. This means your NO shares can be converted into YES shares for any other outcome in that market.

**Example:**

- You hold 1,000 NO shares for outcome 1 Emmanuel Macron.
- You change your mind and think outcome 2, Keir Starmer, is more likely.
- You can convert your 1,000 NO shares from outcome 1 for 1,000 YES shares of outcome 2 without having to add any additional capital.

## Hedging Across Multiple Outcomes

Another added benefit of Space's Multi-Outcome Markets is that it gives you the flexibility to spread your risk.

**Example:**\
You can convert your 1,000 NO shares from Macron into 500 YES shares of Starmer and an additional 500 YES shares of Modi covering both bases and spreading your risk.
