title: "Makers & Takers"
---

Within the Space [CLOB architecture](/features/clob), there are two primary types of participants who drive liquidity and price discovery: makers and takers.

Makers add liquidity to the order book by posting limit orders that sit on the order book until they're matched with an opposing order. These orders help with market depth and establish the bid-ask spread.

Takers place limit or market orders that execute immediately as they're matched with the existing maker orders and remove liquidity from the pool.
