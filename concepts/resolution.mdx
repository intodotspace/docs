## Deterministic Resolution

Crypto prices and on-chain events settle automatically via verifiable blockchain data at expiration. Read more about the development side of deterministic resolution [here](/resolution/deterministic).

## Oracle Resolution

Real-world events resolve through trusted data sources within 24h of expiry - ensuring accuracy and finality. Read more about the development side of oracle resolution [here](/resolution/oracle).

## Future Infrastructure

Space is pioneering cryptographic verification methods (zkML, zkTLS) to enable trustless resolution of off-chain events.

## Rules and Logic

Resolution criteria are explicitly defined in each market description before trading begins.
