title: "Market Resolution"
---

Space uses resolution methods optimized for each market type.

## Deterministic Resolution
Crypto prices and on-chain events settle automatically via verifiable blockchain data at expiration.

## Oracle Resolution
Real-world events resolve through trusted data sources within 24h of expiry - ensuring accuracy and finality.

## Future Infrastructure
Space is pioneering cryptographic verification methods (zkML, zkTLS) to enable trustless resolution of off-chain events.

## Rules and Logic
Resolution criteria are explicitly defined in each market description before trading begins.
