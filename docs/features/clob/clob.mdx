Space operates on a Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) architecture - the same model used by traditional stock exchanges which transparently displays orders on-chain within the order book. The platform continuously matches compatible buys (bids) with sells (asks) at chosen prices and traders provide liquidity by posting orders on both sides. Price emerges from user supply and demand.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Order Placement" titleSize="h3">
    You buy shares in a YES or NO outcome stating the price and quantity of shares. For example paying $0.25 per share means there is a 25% chance this outcome will happen; if guessed correctly these shares will be worth $1 on expiry, if incorrectly they'll be worth $0
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Order Matching" titleSize="h3">
    Instead of trading against the platform, you trade against other users; everyone can place buy or sell orders and when prices match, the trade takes place automatically. Orders that do not immediately match remain open in the order book until filled, cancelled, or expired.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Order Resolution" titleSize="h3">
    If you bet correctly when the market resolves, all your winning shares that you bought for $0.25 are then cashed out at $1 value. And your incorrect shares will be cashed out at $0.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Continuous Trading" titleSize="h3">
    The Space Continuous Trading structure enables real-time, continuous trading of prediction markets where you can enter and exit at any point without needing to wait until resolution. More information on this in Continuous Markets.
