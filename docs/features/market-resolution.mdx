## Resolution

Market resolution will depend on the market; in early versions, some markets such as cryptocurrency predictions will be resolved using on-chain data at the expiration date, others will be determined manually by the team within 24h of market expiry. Whereas later versions of Space might explore other advanced techniques to implement market resolution algorithms, such as zkML and zkTLS.

## Rules and Logic

Each market has its own resolution rules and logic which will be stated in the description of the market beneath the chart.
