Another added benefit of Space’s Multi-Outcome Markets is that it gives you the flexibility to spread your risk.

**Example:**
You can convert your 1,000 NO shares from Macron into 500 YES shares of Starmer and an additional 500 YES shares of Modi covering both bases and spreading your risk.

Space’s Multi-Outcome Markets represent a significant evolution in prediction market architecture, combining the best aspects of concentrated liquidity, capital efficiency, and intuitive user experience. By enabling seamless position shifts through share conversion, Space makes it easier than ever to trade complex, multi-possibility events while adapting to breaking news and changing circumstances without being locked into your initial prediction.
