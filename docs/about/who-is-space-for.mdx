title: "Who is Space For?"
---

We built this for anyone who wants their view counted. For the neighbor who notices a pattern in their city, the engineer who has a hunch after reading a paper, the journalist who tracks a story, the student testing an idea - as much as for the economist or analyst. We made this for the ones who privilege clarity of belief and willingness to put it on the line.

This is an open field. Traders come for price opportunities; citizens come for signals; curious people come to learn. All are necessary. A platform that closes itself to non-experts loses the very diversity of observation that makes markets useful. We want low barriers to entry, clear rules, and straightforward tools so anyone with something to say can speak-and be heard in the currency of commitment.

At the same time we recognise the value of measured judgment. When someone with deep knowledge participates, their stake is another kind of signal - but it is only a signal among many. The system treats every contribution by its effect on price and outcome, not by the letter after someoneâ€™s name. Reputation and accuracy are rewarded, not status alone.

The design is intentionally two-sided: contributors of insight and consumers of forecasts feed one another. As more distinct voices join, prices sharpen; as prices sharpen, more users arrive to read them, act on them, and add liquidity. That feedback loop keeps rolling and growing in volume, making public knowledge usefully visible.

So join as you are - novice, professional, skeptic, or believer. Bring a wager, an opinion, a question, or simply your attention. The platform is open because good signals can begin anywhere; our work is to make them audible, auditable, and valuable.
