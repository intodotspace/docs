title: "SPL Token Structure"
---
Every market uses SPL tokens to represent shares:
- **YES tokens** = outcome happens
- **NO tokens** = outcome doesn't happen
- Each pair is backed by 1 USDC

## Minting & Burning
Mint: 1 USDC → 1 YES + 1 NO
Burn: 1 YES + 1 NO → 1 USDC
This mechanism ensures:
- YES + NO ≈ \$1 (price integrity)
- Always-available liquidity
- Capital efficiency in multi-outcome markets
## Why This Matters

If the order book is thin, you're never stuck. Mint a pair for \$1, sell the side you don't want. This creates your own liquidity without relying on other traders.

### Arbitrage Enforcement

If YES = \$0.65 and NO = \$0.40 (sum = \$1.05), arbitrageurs can:
    1. Buy both for \$1.05
    2. Burn for \$1.00
    3. Repeat until prices balance
This keeps YES + NO ≈ \$1 across all markets.
