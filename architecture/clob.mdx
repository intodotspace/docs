title: "CLOB & Order Matching"
description: "How trades execute on the order book"
---

Space runs on Solana using a Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) where users trade directly against each other. No house, no middleman, no AMM curves-just transparent order matching and real price discovery.

## How the Order Book Works

<div align="center">
```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Place Order] --> B{Immediate Match?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Execute as Taker - Pay Fee]
    B -->|No| D[Add to Book as Maker - 0% Fee]
    D --> E[Wait for Match - Earn Rewards]
    E --> C
```

</div>

[Makers](/concepts/makers-and-takers) post limit orders, pay 0% fees and earn rewards for adding liquidity. [Takers](/concepts/makers-and-takers) hit existing orders and pay dynamic fees based on market probability.

Orders match on price-time priority. Best price gets filled first; equal prices fill oldest orders first.

**Order Lifecycle**

- User places market or limit order
- Matching engine checks for counterparty
- If match found → execute immediately (taker)
- If no match → add to order book (maker)
- Order sits until matched, cancelled, or expired

## Price Discovery

Prices emerge from supply and demand. Every order is visible on-chain. The order book is transparent-no hidden liquidity, no preferential treatment.
