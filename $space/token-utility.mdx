**Utility**

The utilities below are designed to enhance the efficiency and usability of prediction markets without restricting demand from the user base. Requiring users to buy, hold or stake tokens in order to use a product gates access to it; at Space, we want to enable everyone to use the platform without forcing them to interact with the token as this would limit demand and user base.

We ensured that the token utility directly ties token value to the platform performance, not just speculation; direct exposure to platform success through revenue sharing played a major part in the success of Raydium & Aerodrome (CFA Institute, 2025).

1. **Trading** certain markets using only **$SPACE** (native token)

2. **Rewards**
    - **Liquidity Provision:** When CLOB model implemented, users that provide liquidity with limit orders close to the price earn rewards in **$SPACE** proportional to the volume.
    - **Referral rewards** for referring friends that deposit USDC and trade
    - **Trading competitions** similar to Polymarket to boost engagement and liquidity

3. **Market Protection:** Burn **$SPACE** to place large bids compared to the volume of the market (e.g. vol=10m, user wants to bid 5m more). Helps with protecting markets from manipulation e.g. when Kamala turned odds on Polymarket in her favour by 20m bet.
